And \chord{D}I never \chord{A}thought I'd feel\chord{Hm} this way \chord{Em} \\
And as far as I'm concer\chord{d$^{7/5-}$}ned \\
I'm glad I \chord{F\#$^{sus4}$}got the chance\chord{F\#} to say \\
\chord{Hm} \ That I \chord{Em}do believe you ne\chord{A}ed it \\

And if math should ever go away / Well then close your eyes and try \\
To think the way we do today / And then if you can't remember \ldots \\

\refrain{
	\chord{D} Keep smiling, \chord{A} and deriving \\
	\chord{G}Knowin' you can always count\chord{A} on proofs \chord{F\#m} , for sure\chord{Hm} \\
	\chord{G}That’s what math is for \chord{A} \\
	\chord{D} To find primes, \chord{A} for bad times \\
	\chord{C}It’ll be in your keys \chord{H} forever mor\chord{A$^{5-}$}e -- \ \ \ \  \chord{A$^{sus4}$}That's what math is for \chord{A}}

\textcolor{\chordcolor}{D \ \ A \ \ h}  \\
\chord{Em} \ Understand complexity\chord{d$^{7/5-}$} \\
And now there's \chord{F\#$^{sus4}$}so much more \chord{F\#}I see \\
\chord{Hm} \ And so \chord{Em}by the way I thank \chord{A}you \ldots \\

Ohhh and then when your code falls all apart \\
Well just close your eyes and know \\
This problem is just NP hard \\
And then if you can't remember \ldots Ohhhhh \\
