\subsection{Make It Slow}
\songinfo{Idina Menzel -- Let It Go}{Dominik Schreiber}

The \chord{Em}servers do heavy \chord{C}lifting tonight \\
``Out of \chord{D}memory'' 's what they \chord{Am}claim \\
Not a \chord{Em}program seems to \chord{C}work \\
And it \chord{D}looks like I'm to \chord{A}blame \\

\chord{Em} The cooler's \chord{C}howling like this \chord{D}swirling storm in\chord{Am}side \\
\chord{Em} Couldn't make it \chord{D}work, heaven knows I \chord{A} tried \\

\prechorus{
\chord{D} Don't share the code, don't let them see \\
\chord{C} Pretend you know what you're doing here \\
\chord{D} Conceal your code, don't let them know \\
\chord{C} The bill will show
}

\refrain{
Make it slow\chord{G}, make it slow\chord{D} \\
Write in \chord{Em}Java or in Go\chord{C} \\
Make it slow\chord{G}, make it slow\chord{D} \\
See the \chord{Em}memory usage grow\chord{C} \\

\chord{G}I don't care\chord{D} what they're \chord{Em}going to say\chord{C} \\
Let Brute \chord{Hm}force rage on\chord{Bb} \\
Run \chord{Am}times never bothered me anyway} \\

\chord{G}\ \ \ \ \chord{D}\ \ \ \ \chord{Em} It's funny how\chord{C} abstractions \\
make \chord{D}everything seem fine\chord{Am} \\
\chord{Em} And the pointers that I\chord{D} once feared \\
Are locked a\chord{A4}way without a \chord{-3}sign \\

\prechorus{
It's time to see what I can do \\
with a lot of power and not a clue \\
No right, no wrong, no rules for me -- I'm free 
}

\refrain{
Make it slow, make it slow \\
See the servers start to cry \\
Make it slow, make it slow \\
You'll never see me try \\
To implement something good and sound \\
Let brute force rage on --}

\chord{C} My exponential methods calculate away \\
An input size of twelve, and it runs for half a day \\
\chord{D} And one thought rises like the temperatures in here \\
\chord{Em} I can't do \chord{C}any better, \chord{D}that much is now clear\chord{Am} \\

\refrain{
Make it slow, make it slow \\
It still computes at the break of dawn \\
Make it slow, make it slow \\
Efficiency is gone \\
And eventually, it will work, I pray \\
Let Brute force rage on \\
Run times never bothered me anyway}
