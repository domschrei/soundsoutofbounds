\chord{F\#m} \ She calls out to the man \chord{E} at the desk \chord{Hm7} \\
\chord{F\#m} \ \glqq Sir, can you help \chord{E} me? \\
\chord{F\#m} \ I'm in a hurry and this \chord{E}printer seems dead, \chord{Hm7} \\
\chord{F\#m} \ Anything you can do \chord{E} here?\grqq \\

He sighes, stands up and helps \\
He pretends to be caring \\
Starts to sweat as he unplugs the device \\
This old thing shouldn't be there \\

\refrain{There's \chord{F\#m}noooo re\chord{C\#m}sort \\
	It's an\chord{D$^\Delta$}other day for you and me in \chord{E}tech support \\
	Re\chord{F\#m}boot, and a\chord{C\#m}bort, \\
	It's an\chord{D$^\Delta$}other day for you, \chord{E}you and me in tech support}

(Think about it) \\

She calls out to the man on the phone \\
He can hear she's been crying \\
She's got a lot of malware, toolbars and more \\
She can't browse, but she's trying \\

\chord{E} \ Oh Lo\chord{F\#m}rd,\ \ \ \ I \chord{E}hate to be one of those poor \chord{A}guys \\
\chord{E}Oh Lo\chord{A}rd, there must be \chord{E}something I could change \chord{A} \\

You can tell from the constant pop-ups \\
That the updates are piling \\
This machine takes twelve minutes to boot \\
So deformed it's disgusting \\

\refrain{
	Noooo resort \\
	cause it's another day for you and me in tech support \\
	Reboot, and abort, \\
	It's another day for you, you and me in tech support, tech support \\
	Just think about it, tech support, just think about it \\
	Tech support, tech support, tech support}
