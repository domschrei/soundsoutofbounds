\chord{Em} Another sma\chord{C}rtphone purchased, child\chord{G} is slowly ta\chord{D}ken \\
\chord{Em} and the texting cau\chord{C}ses silence, who \chord{G} are we mista\chord{D}ken \\

But you see \chord{Em} they're not free, they just blin\chord{C}dly agree \\
in their chat\chord{G}, in their chat they are smi\chord{D}ling \\
With their apps\chord{Em} and their phones and their watch \chord{C} and their apps \\
in the stores\chord{G}, in the stores they are buy\chord{D}ing \\

\refrain{
	In your \chord{Em}chat, in your \chord{C}chat \\
	Smombie\chord{G}\footnote{Jugendwort des Jahres 2015; zusammengesetzt aus \glqq Smartphone\grqq \ und \glqq Zombie\grqq}, Smombie, Smombie\chord{D}-e-e- \\
	What's in your \chord{Em}chat, in your \chord{C}chat? \\
	Smombie\chord{G}, Smombie, Smombie\chord{D}-e-e-}

Another super-trendy octacore takes over \\
When the hightech causes silence, we must be mistaken \\

It's the same old theme that Steve Jobs has foreseen \\
in the stores, in the stores they are buying \\
With their apps and their phones and their watch and their apps \\
in their chat, in their chat they are smiling \\

\refrain{
	What's in your chat, in your chat? \\
	Smombie, Smombie, Smombie-e-e- \\
	What's in your chat, in your chat? \\
	Smombie, Smombie, Smombie-e-e-}
