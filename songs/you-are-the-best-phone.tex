\refrain{
	You must have known that I was lonely, \\
	Because you linked me to Facebook, too \\
	And I know million friends are close to me, \\
	How could so much power be inside of you?}

You are the best phone of my life \\
That's why I'll always keep you on, \\
You are the apple of my I-phone \\
Forever you'll stay in my palm. \\
