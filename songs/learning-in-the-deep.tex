\subsection{Learning In The Deep}
\songinfo{Adele -- Rolling In The Deep}{Simon Reiß, Dominik Schreiber}

\chord{Hm}There’s desire for \chord{F\#m}cleverer machines\\
\chord{A}We need more fancy stuff than \chord{F\#m}medians and \chord{A}means\\
\chord{Hm}Neural networks work \chord{F\#m}pretty well in brains\\
\chord{A}Why not just simulate \chord{F\#m}what our head contains? \chord{A}\\

See how easy I’ll choose the neuron count\\
Don’t underestimate the weighted sums of those\\
They start firing leading to a loss\\
Backpropagate it, and the accuracy grows\\

\prechorus{
\chord{G} The countless \chord{A}layers will find an \chord{F\#m}answer\\
They keep me \chord{G}thinking we can achieve it \chord{G}all\\
Your weight ad\chord{A}justments, they leave me \chord{F\#m}breathless\\
I can’t help feeling
}

\refrain{
We can achieve it \chord{Hm}all\ \ \textit{You’ll never wish for }\chord{A}\textit{anything else again}\\
Learning in the \chord{G}deep\ \ \textit{The error’s gonna fall, learning in the deep)}\\
We \chord{A}have the tool in\chord{Hm}side of our \chord{A}hands\ \ \textit{You’ll never wish for anything else again}\\
So let’s tra\chord{G}in it for our need(s)\ \ \textit{Gradients getting small, learning in the deep}
}

Baby, I have some data just for you\\
Regression might work as well, but I don’t have a clue\\
Find some patterns in the depths of edges and weights\\
Make your prediction smart, decrease your learning rates\\

\prechorus{
The countless layers will find an answer\\
%(You’ll never wish for anything else again)
They keep me thinking that we can achieve it all\\
%(The error’s gonna fall, learning in the deep)
Your weight adjustments, they leave me breathless\\
%(You’ll never wish for anything else again)
I can’t help feeling
%(Gradients getting small, learning in the deep)
}

Throwing your kind on every open task\\
You have an answer for whatever I may ask\\
Turn my sorrow into fun and hype\\
Make me forget all other classifier types\\

\chord{Hm}\textit{You’ll never wish for \chord{A}anything else again}\\
We can achieve it \chord{G}all\\
\textit{The error’s gonna fall, \chord{A}learning in the deep}\\
We can achieve it \chord{Hm}all\\
\textit{You’ll never wish for \chord{A}anything else again}\\
It \chord{G}all, it all, it all\ \ \ \textit{Gradients getting small, learning in the deep}\\

\refrefrain \refrain{
We can achieve it \chord{Hm}all\ \ \textit{You’ll never wish for }\chord{A}\textit{anything else again}\\
Learning in the \chord{G}deep\ \ \textit{The error’s gonna fall, learning in the deep)}\\
We \chord{A}have the tool in\chord{Hm}side of our \chord{A}hands\ \ \textit{You’ll never wish for anything else again}\\
But we fai\chord{G}led it, Used poor data, Overfitted\\
And \chord{A}all results are \chord{Hm}crap.
