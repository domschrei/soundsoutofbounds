\chord{G}Many branches \chord{Hm}flourished \\
\chord{C}some of them, they \chord{G}grew \\

Tux had a companion who was a little GNU \\
In Unity\footnote{\scriptsize Desktopumgebung von Canonical für Ubuntu-Systeme}, they went along \\
did what they wanted to. \\
They met a green chamaeleon \\
and Suse\footnote{\scriptsize openSUSE: Linux-Distribution mit einem Chamaeleon-Maskottchen} was its’ name \\
they drank delicious Mate\footnote{\scriptsize Desktopumgebung, u.A. in Linux Mint} tea \\ 
and played some freeware game. \\

A hairy guy called Richard, idealist and tough, \\
he interjected and remarked, \\
\glqq \glq Free of charge\grq \ is not enough!\grqq \\
He told the friends to quickly get rid of all the things \\
That weren't Libre Open Source \\
\glqq You'll be Free\grqq, the man still sings.\footnote{\scriptsize Richard Stallman Free Software Song: \texttt{https://youtu.be/9sJUDx7iEJw}} \\

Tux looked through a window \\
Weirdly shaped as ‘X’\footnote{\scriptsize X Window Server: Protokoll für die Darstellung grafischer Oberflächen bei Linux-Systemen, mittlerweile als veraltet angesehen}, \\
The old thing just should be replaced \\ 
By something less complex \\
This task did seem so easy \\
But wasn’t quite as planned \\
It took at least some more decades \\
‘Til there was a way to land\footnote{\scriptsize Wayland: neues Protokoll für grafische Oberflächen, das X ablösen soll}. \\

\refrefrain

Mascots live forever but not so human devs \\
Their chief, called Linus, screamed at all \\
who’d make a kernel mess \\
Some became offended and didn’t want no more \\
But Tux will surely overcome, \\
by a fork or with the core. \\
