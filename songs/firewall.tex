\chord{d} Today is \chord{F}gonna be the day \\
That they’re \chord{C}gonna throw their shit at \chord{G}you \\
\chord{d}By now you \chord{F}should’ve somehow  \\
been pro\chord{C}grammed what you gotta do \chord{G} \\
\chord{d}I don’t believe that a\chord{F}nybody \\
can \chord{C}guard me as well as you \chord{G} do right no\chord{d}w \chord{F} \ \ \chord{C} \ \ \chord{G}\\

Online the word was in the threads \\
Some new malware’s pushing through \\
I’m sure they’ve hacked it all before \\
But I still believe in you \\
I don’t believe that anybody \\
can guard me as well as you do right now \\

And all\chord{Bb} the websites that \chord{C} I use are wi\chord{d}nding \\
And all\chord{Bb} the download bu\chord{C}ttons are so bli\chord{d}nding \\
\chord{Bb}There may be some things\chord{C} that I should \chord{F}configure\chord{C} in you\chord{d} \\
(But I don't know \chord{G}how) – \\

\refrain{
	Because \chord{Bb}maybe \chord{d} \\
	\chord{F} You're \chord{C}gonna be the one that \chord{Bb}saves me \chord{d}\\
	\chord{F} ‘Cause \chord{C}after all \chord{Bb} \ \ \ \ \chord{d} \\
	\chord{F} You're my \chord{C}firew\chord{Bb}all \ \chord{d}  \ \ \chord{F} \ \ \chord{G}}

Today you’ve gotten in their way \\
But they’re never gonna give that up \\
By now you have somehow \\
Realized who is not allowed \\
I don’t believe that anybody \\
can guard me as well as you do right now \\

And all the trojan horses are proceeding \\
And all the download buttons are misleading \\
There may be some things that I should configure in you \\
(But I don't know how) – \\

\refrain{
	Because maybe \\
	You're gonna be the one that saves me \\
	‘Cause after all \\
	You're my firewall \\
	
	I said maybe \\
	You're gonna be the one that saves me \\
	And after all \\
	You're my firewall \\
	
	I said \chord{Bb}maybe \chord{d} \\
	\chord{F} You're gonna be the one that \chord{Bb}saves me \chord{d}\\
	\chord{F} You're gonna be the one that \chord{Bb}saves me \chord{d}\\
	\chord{F} You're gonna be the one that \chord{Bb}saves me}
