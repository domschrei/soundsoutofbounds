\chord{Dm} Today is \chord{F}gonna be the day \\
That they’re \chord{C}gonna throw their shit at \chord{G}you \\
\chord{Dm}By now you \chord{F}should’ve somehow  \\
been pro\chord{C}grammed what you gotta do \chord{G} \\
\chord{Dm}I don’t believe that a\chord{F}nybody \\
can \chord{C}guard me as well as you \chord{G} do right no\chord{Dm}w \ \ \ \chord{F} \ \ \chord{C} \ \ \chord{G}\\

Online the word was in the threads \\
Some new malware’s pushing through \\
I’m sure they’ve hacked it all before \\
But I still believe in you \\
I don’t believe that anybody \\
can guard me as well as you do right now \\

\prechorus{
And all\chord{Bb} the websites that \chord{C} I use are wi\chord{Dm}nding \\
And all\chord{Bb} the download bu\chord{C}ttons are so bli\chord{Dm}nding \\
\chord{Bb}There may be some things\chord{C} that I should \chord{F}configure\chord{C} in you\chord{Dm} \\
(But I don't know \chord{G}how) --
}

\refrain{
	Because \chord{Bb}maybe \chord{Dm} \\
	\chord{F} You're \chord{C}gonna be the one that \chord{Bb}saves me \chord{Dm}\\
	\chord{F} ‘Cause \chord{C}after all \chord{Bb} \ \ \ \ \chord{Dm} \\
	\chord{F} You're my \chord{C}firew\chord{Bb}all \ \chord{Dm} \ \ \ \ \ \chord{F} \ \ \chord{G}}

Today you’ve gotten in their way \\
But they’re never gonna give that up \\
By now you have somehow \\
Realized who is not allowed \\
I don’t believe that anybody \\
can guard me as well as you do right now \\

\prechorus{
And all the trojan horses are proceeding \\
And all the download buttons are misleading \\
There may be some things that I should configure in you \\
(But I don't know how) --}

\refrain{
	Because maybe \\
	You're gonna be the one that saves me \\
	‘Cause after all \\
	You're my firewall \\
	
	I said maybe \\
	You're gonna be the one that saves me \\
	And after all \\
	You're my firewall \\
	
	I said \chord{Bb}maybe \chord{Dm} \\
	\chord{F} You're gonna be the one that \chord{Bb}saves me \chord{Dm}\\
	\chord{F} You're gonna be the one that \chord{Bb}saves me \chord{Dm}\\
	\chord{F} You're gonna be the one that \chord{Bb}saves me}
